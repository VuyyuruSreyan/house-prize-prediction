# 🏡 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project is a supervised machine learning model built to predict house prices based on various features such as number of rooms, area, location, and more. It showcases the practical application of regression techniques in real-world data scenarios.

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Goal:** Predict the price of a house given its features.
- **Model Type:** Regression (Linear Regression)
- **Tools Used:** Python, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Deployment:** Frontend built with HTML & CSS, integrated with a Python Flask backend.

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source:** [Kaggle Housing Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/)
- **Features include:**  
  - OverallQual (Overall material and finish quality)  
  - GrLivArea (Above grade living area square feet)  
  - GarageCars, GarageArea  
  - TotalBsmtSF, YearBuilt, and more

> Data preprocessing was performed to handle missing values, encode categorical data, and scale numerical features before model training.

## ⚙️ Machine Learning Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning & Exploration**
2. **Feature Engineering**
3. **Model Training (Linear Regression)**
4. **Model Evaluation (RMSE, R² Score)**
5. **Web Application Integration**

## 🚀 Deployment

A lightweight Flask web application allows users to input house features and get real-time price predictions. The app includes:

- HTML/CSS frontend
- Python backend for model inference
- Clean and user-friendly UI

## 📈 Model Performance

- **RMSE:** 28,563.4 (example)
- **R² Score:** 0.89 (example)
- **Test Accuracy:** ~89.2%  
> *Note: These are sample values. Replace them with your actual results.*

## 🧠 Key Skills Demonstrated

- End-to-end machine learning pipeline
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model evaluation and tuning
- Deployment of ML models with Flask
- Git/GitHub for version control and collaboration
